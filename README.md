# flask-zipkin

a flask zipkin extension based on py_zipkin.

## Installation

```bash
pip install flask_zipkin
```

## usage

you can simply use it as other flask extensions.

```python
from flask_zipkin import Zipkin

zipkin = Zipkin(app, sample_rate=10)
app.config['ZIPKIN_DSN'] = "http://127.0.0.1:9411/api/v1/spans"
```

## Advance Usage

you could gen a header to pass it to other services, the downstream service will receive this header.

```python
@bp.route('/')
def hello():
    headers = {}
    headers.update(zipkin.create_http_headers_for_new_span())
    r = requests.get('http://localhost:5001', headers=headers)
    return r.text
```



`flask_zipkin` will use http transport by default. You could define a transport, like:

```python
@zipkin.transport_handler
def default_handler(encoded_span):
    return requests.post(
		'your transport dsn',
        data=encoded_span,
        headers={'Content-Type': 'application/x-thrift'},
)
```


`flask_zipkin` eats all transport exception by default. You could define an exception handler, like:

```python
@zipkin.transport_exception_handler
def default_ex_handler(ex):
    raise ex
```

and also, you could exempt some views, like:

```python
@zipkin.exempt
@bp.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'hello world'
```

add key, value for your tracing record, like:

```python

zipkin.update_tags(id=1, user_id=2)

```



## app configs

`ZIPKIN_DISABLE`  disable zipkin tracking if value is `True`

`ZIPKIN_DSN`  http transport dsn: such as `http://localhost:9411/api/v1/spans`
